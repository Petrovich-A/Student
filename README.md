## :star2: About the Project

<!-- Screenshots -->

The main task is to create a table with group data about students using the PostgreSQL database. This table will store student names, unique student ID, age, and other demographic information about the students in the group. The application must also be able to generate a list of all students in a group.
As an additional task, was created a table with the cities in which the students of the group live. The application must be able to display all information related to each student, including their home and current city. In addition, operations such as adding new cities, new students, deleting students, and deleting cities should be available to the user.
To ensure efficient data access, appropriate indexing should be used when optimizing queries against the PostgreSQL DBMS. The web application must be thoroughly tested and bugs must be corrected and eliminated.
The ultimate goal is to develop a fully functioning and reliable web application with the desired capabilities for both the primary task and the secondary task.

The overflow is not cut off. It is rendered outside of the element's box. This is by default tolerance.
