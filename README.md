## :star2: About the Project

<!-- Screenshots -->

The main task of this project is to display on `JSP` a group data from database using plain `JDBC` and the `PostgreSQL`
database.
Was created two tables: cities and students with `1:M` relationship between two entities respectively. The application
allows
to generate a list of all students and cities. Moreover, can be displayed a resulting table using SQL queries to
database.

The application is able to provide all `CRUD` methods related to each entity in table. Thus, operations such as adding
new cities,
new students, deleting students, and deleting cities are available to the user. Some code coverded with unit tests.

The ultimate goal is to develop a fully functioning and reliable web application with the desired capabilities for both
the primary task and the secondary task.
